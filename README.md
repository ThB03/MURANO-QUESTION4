Code for question 4 - Binance OrderBook in real time\
The code is written in C#, so you need to have the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) or the [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) installed.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed, such as the Newtonsoft.Json package. You can install it using NuGet with the command Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json.\
Check your project configuration to ensure it targets a compatible version of .NET framework or .NET Core. The code should be compatible with .NET Framework 4.5 or later, or .NET Core.

The code could not be tested, since "the server returned status code '451' when status code '101' was expected", but it includes the main requirements and should work properly.
